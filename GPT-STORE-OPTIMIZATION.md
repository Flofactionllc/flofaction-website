# GPT Store & AI Search Optimization Guide for Flo Faction LLC

## Overview
This document outlines strategies to maximize Flo Faction LLC's visibility and rankings in ChatGPT Shop, Perplexity Shopping, and other AI-powered search platforms.

## Core Principles

### 1. Entity Consistency
**CRITICAL**: Always use "Flo Faction LLC" (with space) across ALL platforms:
- Website content and metadata
- GPT names and descriptions  
- Social media profiles
- Directory listings
- Schema markup
- Press releases and content

Inconsistent naming ("FloFaction", "Flo-Faction", "Flow Faction") confuses AI systems and dilutes your brand authority.

### 2. Structured Data is Your Foundation
AI search engines rely heavily on schema.org structured data to understand your business. We've implemented:

✅ **LocalBusiness schema** (index.html) - Establishes Flo Faction LLC as a legitimate business entity
✅ **InsuranceAgency schema** (insurance.html) - Signals insurance authority  
✅ **Service/Product schema** - Details each offering with pricing and descriptions
✅ **FAQPage schema** - Provides AI models with Q&A content to cite
✅ **AggregateRating schema** - Builds trust signals
